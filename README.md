# hello-world
My first GitHub repository!



Hello!

My name is Christopher Hendrix but I go by Chris.
I'm a student at Park University studying Computer Science.
This is my first experiment with GitHub.

Attached below is a public domain image of Choshu Clan samurai I used for my EN306B project last semester.
Just testing to see if it works!
